      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Leading advocate for academic reform and science communication with over 10 years’ experience in immunology and metascience and over 5 years’ experience in science communication including podcasting and writing for scientific, lay and professional audiences. Significant experience in advocacy, network building and relationship cultivation with stakeholders across academia, publishing and industry and a track record of international project management and collaboration. 8 years’ experience advocating for preprint usage and open science adoption through talks, writing, research and community leadership.
 
I have featured on international radio stations (BBC Radio 4, ORF & German National radio) to communicate the importance of preprints in addition to having written for outlets such as The Scientist and the British Society for Cell Biology. My work has been covered by a wide range of news organisations over the past 2 years. I have also contributed to numerous journalistic pieces in outlets including The Economist, The Scientist and Nature on topics from open science to academic culture. 

I am currently on the Advisory boards of [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/Governance), [eiRxiv](https://eirxiv.org/) and [AREN](https://africanrn.org/international-advisory-board/) (Africa Reproducibility Network).  

Outside of work I enjoy climbing, photography, fine-dining, guitars, comedy, live-music and adrenaline-fueled adventures; though now mostly all superceded by my adorable dog, Jessie.
