abstract: Journal clubs! Almost every department and lab group has one. These clubs can be excellent opportunities for early career researchers to gain experience reviewing research, reading critically, and understanding how to communicate more effectively (or how to not communicate, depending on the paper). A good journal club may consist of a number of researchers, each with slightly different areas of expertise who collectively contribute to a critical discussion of a chosen paper. However, these discussions are often kept behind closed doors, and rarely, if ever, shared with the authors of those papers. Almost always, journal club reviews are done on published papers, long after the critical feedback that is generated in the discussion can be useful to a paperâ€™s authors.
