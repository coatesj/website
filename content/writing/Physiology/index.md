abstract: In the fast-paced world of scientific discovery, rapid dissemination of research findings is crucial for accelerating progress and knowledge sharing. However, the traditional publishing system hinders this process, leading to delays, increased costs, and limited access. Preprints, preliminary versions of scientific manuscripts that have not undergone formal peer review, have emerged as game-changers, dismantling barriers, and enabling immediate sharing of scientific ideas. The life sciences have gradually embraced this innovation, with bioRxiv and medRxiv gaining popularity. But in the field of physiology, the adoption of preprints lags behind. Unravelling the intricacies behind this slower uptake, we delve into key metrics of the current landscape and propose actionable strategies to bridge this gap and foster greater adoption.
