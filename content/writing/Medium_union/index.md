abstract: There seems to be no shortage of academic horror stories of late (Sexual abuse, bullying, pensions, department redundancies. Combined with the mass-exodus and difficulties in filling positions  youâ€™d be forgiven for thinking that academia was facing a reckoning or awakening. The choice is simple. Either we take these problems and use them to build a strong foundation for future change or we remain silent, complicit, and lose the best people from academia.
