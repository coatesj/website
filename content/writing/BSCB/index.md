abstract: Physicists have been sharing their work for free as pre-prints since the early 1990s. However, it wasn’t until the launch of bioRxiv in 2013 that the biological science and biomedical communities began to adopt the use of
preprints as a route for sharing new scientific advances. Sharing work as a preprint confers many advantages to
both authors and readers in the scientific community, including quicker dissemination of new findings, free
access, and the referenceable documentation of complet-ed work. Despite this, scepticism of preprints persists in
some pockets of academia. Here, we describe the history and use of preprints to date, as well as recent innovations
around preprint review and collation and how preprints might impact the landscape of science publishing in the
future

summary: Preprints are complete scientific manuscripts that are up-loaded to dedicated, freely accessible preprint servers and have not undergone journal-organised peer review. They are often – although not always – submitted at the same time as, or near to, submission to a traditional journal.
