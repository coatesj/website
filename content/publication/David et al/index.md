abstract: Low- and middle-income countries face obstacles in sharing scientific research globally due to costly publishing fees and biases. Preprints—manuscripts shared before formal journal-organised peer review—offer a potential remedy. However, their uptake, mainly in the USA, UK, and Western Europe, contrasts sharply with limited adoption in Africa. Understanding African researchers' views on preprints remains scant, hindering acceptance. Our survey reveals widespread unawareness regarding preprints and reliance on traditional publishers among African researchers. Of 182 respondents from Nigeria, South Africa, and Tanzania, 41.9% posted preprints, yet 77% were unaware of Africa-specific repositories. While non-posters read preprints, fewer cited or shared them. Social media served as the primary platform for preprint sharing, with concerns over sharing before peer review. Although recognized for accessibility and career enhancement, concerns persisted regarding recognition and co-author unfamiliarity. Encouragement from publishers was vital, but opinions varied on institutional and funder involvement, highlighting differing perceptions in promoting preprints. Additionally, our data suggests that traditional publishers dominate the preprint landscape for Africa-based researchers. This study provides important preliminary information relating to perceptions of preprints across African scholars and highlights the need for urgent further work to increase awareness and adoption of preprints across Africa.
