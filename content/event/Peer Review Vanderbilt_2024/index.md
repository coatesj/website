summary: Transparency in peer review begins to combat some of the problems with an opaque system 
abstract: 'There is a growing distrust in science and scientists. Yet with record breaking numbers of retractions, increasing pressure and precarity and an abundance of perverse incentives with a distinct lack of accountabiity, this is not surprising. To restore trust, transparency in vital. This talk will focus on the importance of transparent peer review in being one part of the solution to distrust and unreliable science.'
