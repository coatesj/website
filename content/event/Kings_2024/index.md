summary: Preprints as a powerful tool for ECRs
abstract: 'ECRs face numerous career challenges, mamy of which are a result of the traditional publishing process. This process harms ECR careers as it is slow, laborious and biased. Preprints represent a route towards greater equity and a fairer academic system. By removing gatekeepers and delays, preprints significantly benefit ECR career advancement.'
